# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the **latest released version on the current major** receives security
updates. Older majors and older patch releases within the current major do
not receive backports. Pin to a SHA in production (see [README](./README.md#pinning)).

| Version | Supported |
|---------|-----------|
| Latest release on the current major (e.g., the newest `v1.y.z`) | ✅ |
| Older `v1.y.z` releases | ❌ |
| Older majors (e.g., `v0.x`) | ❌ |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Do not open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Use GitHub's [private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/lowlydba/stac-check-action/security/advisories/new) to report any security issue. You should receive an acknowledgement within **72 hours**.

Include:

- Affected version (tag or SHA)
- Reproduction steps or proof-of-concept
- Impact assessment (confidentiality / integrity / availability)
- Suggested fix, if any

## Scope

This action is a thin composite wrapper around the upstream [`stac-check`](https://github.com/stac-utils/stac-check) CLI. Vulnerabilities in `stac-check` itself should be reported to the [stac-utils](https://github.com/stac-utils/stac-check/security) project. Report here only issues in the action's:

- Shell argument construction / injection vectors
- Permission escalation paths
- Secret exposure
- Supply chain (action SHA pinning, dependency declarations)

## Disclosure

Coordinated disclosure preferred. Embargo period negotiable based on severity.
